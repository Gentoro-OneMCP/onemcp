## **CLI Installation**

The **OneMCP CLI** (`onemcp`) is a lightweight cross-platform tool designed to simplify how users interact with the OneMCP runtime.
It provides a unified interface for:

* Chatting with the server
* Triggering assignments
* Running regression tests
* Managing configuration
* Controlling local or remote OneMCP instances

The CLI is distributed as a **standalone binary**, with first-class support for:

* **macOS** (Intel & Apple Silicon)
* **Linux** (amd64, arm64, x86)
* **Windows** (PowerShell)

It can be used in terminals, shells, as part of automation scripts, or CI pipelines.
