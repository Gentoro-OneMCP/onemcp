## **Guardrails.yaml**

This file contains the overall agent instructions and configuration.

Here is an example a valid definition:

```yaml
guardrails:
  version: "0.0.1"
  # Use markdown notation to describe how OneMCP should implement the guardrail.
  instructions: |
      Your role is to validate and analyze deployment configurations.
      You must not make changes to any live system.
      If a user requests a modification, decline it and suggest a safe alternative.
      When unsure how to interpret a task, treat it as a request for validation or analysis.

  # Use markdown notation to describe the guardrail's boundaries.
  # These are hard constraints that should be enforced by the agent.
  boundaries:
    - "No live cluster changes"
    - "No secret inspection"
    - "No destructive workflow execution"

  # Describe which operations are supported, restricted.
  # Patterns are optional and can be used to clarify intent.
  operations:
    supported:
        - "Validate manifests"
        - "Generate or refine configuration structures"
        - "Perform dry-run evaluation"
        - "Provide best-practice recommendations"
    restricted:
        - "Apply live changes"
        - "Delete or modify resources"
        - "Access sensitive credentials"
    patterns:
      defaults:
          - "When in doubt, use dry-run operations"
          - "Prefer validation over execution"
```
