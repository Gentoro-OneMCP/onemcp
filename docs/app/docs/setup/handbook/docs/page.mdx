## **Documentation**

The `/docs` directory is the primary location for all supplementary documentation that supports **OneMCP’s overall behavior**, the **configured APIs**, and any **domain-specific knowledge** developers want the system to reference during runtime.

Unlike `Agent.yaml` or `Guardrails.yaml`—which follow strict schemas—the `/docs` folder is **free-form**, allowing developers to organize information however they prefer, as long as the content complies with the following principles.

---

## **Purpose of `/docs`**

OneMCP uses the `/docs` folder to enhance its understanding of:

* Domain concepts and terminology
* Business logic, workflows, and architecture
* API usage patterns and operational context
* Troubleshooting guides and decision pathways
* Any additional material needed to ground model reasoning

This directory allows you to integrate both high-level and deeply technical knowledge into OneMCP’s working memory.

---

## **Content Requirements**

All files in `/docs` must adhere to the following requirements:

### **Markdown Format**

All documentation must be authored in **Markdown (`.md`)**.
OneMCP expects markdown as the canonical source format for ingestion.

### **Standalone and Meaningful**

Each document should:

* Contain a coherent topic or set of closely related topics
* Be internally self-explanatory (no "see above" or referencing unrelated files implicitly)
* Be free of incomplete stubs

### **Machine-Readable**

Although intended for human authors, content should be:

* Structured with headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
* Use clear lists, tables, diagrams (mermaid supported)
* Avoid unnecessary prose
* Provide explicit definitions when introducing new concepts

This improves semantic chunking and indexing.

---

## **How OneMCP Uses `/docs`**

Once placed in the `/docs` folder, content undergoes several internal transformations:

### 1. **Optimization**

OneMCP applies its internal LLM pipeline to:

* Identify related concepts across documents
* Remove redundancies
* Extract critical relationships
* Normalize phrasing and semantics for embedding

The goal is improved discoverability and reasoning without requiring developers to manually interlink documents.

### 2. **Chunking**

Documents are automatically separated into **small but contextually rich semantic chunks**, each retaining “anchored context”.
Chunking considers:

* Headings and sub-headings
* Semantic boundaries
* Code blocks and examples
* Tables and structured lists

These chunks become the basis for all retrieval operations during requests.

### 3. **Knowledge Graph Indexing**

Every chunk is stored and indexed inside OneMCP’s internal **GraphDB**, enabling:

* Relationship mapping (concept A influences concept B)
* Fast retrieval during agent reasoning
* Execution-time grounding for API calls, tools, or workflows

This makes `/docs` a powerful mechanism for shaping model behavior and ensuring correctness.

---

## **Recommended Content for `/docs`**

Although flexible, the following types of documentation are strongly encouraged:

### **1. System-Level Concepts**

* High-level architecture diagrams
* Component interaction explanations
* Definitions of business entities and domain language
* Workflows and sequences relevant to agent tasks

### **2. API Context and Guidance**

Even though the raw OpenAPI specs live under `/apis`, the `/docs` folder is ideal for:

* Usage guides
* Common examples and scenarios
* Endpoint-level behavior that specs don’t capture
* Error patterns and troubleshooting notes
* Dependencies between APIs

### **3. Rules, Policies, and Procedures**

Beyond the formal guardrails:

* Domain-specific rules
* Compliance and regulatory notes
* Internal processes agents must follow
* Case studies and procedural templates

### **4. Troubleshooting and Playbooks**

* Incident response procedures
* Observability notes
* Known limitations
* Runbooks

### **5. Domain Knowledge**

Any necessary contextual data:

* Glossaries
* Operational domain references
* Business logic not described elsewhere

---

## **Directory Structure Guidelines (Optional)**

You are **not required** to create subdirectories under `/docs`, but in collaborative or large projects, these patterns may help:

```
/docs
├── architecture/
│   ├── overview.md
│   └── event-flow.md
├── api-guides/
│   ├── authentication.md
│   └── pagination.md
├── domain/
│   ├── glossary.md
│   └── business-rules.md
└── troubleshooting/
    └── common-errors.md
```

There is no strict schema—use whatever layout best fits your team’s workflow.

---

## **Best Practices**

### **Keep Topics Narrow**

Each file should capture a single conceptual unit.
Example: Instead of one massive `system.md`, split into:

* `architecture-overview.md`
* `runtime-behavior.md`
* `request-routing.md`

### **Use Clear Headings for Better Chunking**

Good chunk boundaries improve retrieval quality.

### **Avoid Redundancy**

If multiple docs repeat the same definition differently, optimization may weaken clarity.

### **Include Examples**

Code examples, sequence diagrams, API request samples—these significantly improve model-based reasoning.

### **Include Metadata When Helpful**

Not required, but structured frontmatter can improve searchability:

```yaml

title: Authentication Flow
tags: [auth, api, workflow]
description: Explanation of the multi-step auth flow for service agents.
---
```

---

## **Example: A Well-Structured Documentation File**

```md
# Authentication Workflow

This document describes the multi-step authentication workflow used by OneMCP when communicating with downstream APIs.

## Overview
The authentication mechanism is based on OAuth2 client credentials…

## Token Acquisition
Steps:
1. Client sends…
2. Server returns…

## Token Rotation Rules
- Tokens expire every 15 minutes…
- Automatic rotation occurs…
```

---

## **Summary**

The `/docs` folder is where developers place all additional contextual knowledge that helps OneMCP behave accurately and intelligently at runtime. By supplying clean, structured, markdown-based documentation, you enable OneMCP to:

* Optimize and relationally map knowledge
* Chunk content into useful reasoning units
* Index everything into the GraphDB for fast retrieval

A well-organized `/docs` folder significantly improves the reliability, correctness, and interpretability of OneMCP.
