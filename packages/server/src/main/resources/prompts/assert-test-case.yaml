      ## **Assignment**
      
        Given the following content:
      
        ```json
      {{ ident( formatted_content, 4) | raw }}   
        ```
      
        Confirm if the content adheres to the following assertion:
      
        ```md
      {{ ident( assertion, 4) | raw }}   
        ```
              
        To share the result of the assertion, output a JSON object with the following structure:
        
        ```json
        {
          "passed": true | false,
          "reason": "{optional explanation of why the assertion failed}"
        }
        ```

      ## 📝 Task Assignment
      {% if error_reported == true %}
        The initial execution failed because the output was not valid JSON. You MUST adhere to the JSON schema specified in your system instructions.
      
        The previous faulty output, which you must correct for JSON syntax, was:
        ```
      {{ ident( result, 4) | raw }}
        ```
      
        The reported error was:
        ```
      {{ ident( error, 4) | raw }}
        ```
      
        Please re-process the original instructions, apply the three steps (Refine, Extract, Isolate), and output a single, strictly valid JSON object.
      {% else %}
        **Generate the complete JSON according the above specification.**
            
      {% endif %}
        ```json
          // Place the corrected valid JSON here
        ```
