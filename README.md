# Gentoro OneMCP

OneMCP is an open-source runtime that makes it easy for AI agents to use your API accurately and efficiently.

You provide your API materials — such as the specification, documentation, and authentication details (collectively called the handbook) — and OneMCP immediately exposes your system through a single, natural-language interface.

It removes the need to handcraft MCP tools or connectors while achieving high performance and low token cost through a smart execution-plan system designed for caching and reuse.

## 🚀 Quick Start


First, install the CLI:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentoro-OneMCP/onemcp/main/packages/cli/install.sh | bash
```

Then start chatting (auto-setup wizard launches on first run):

```bash
onemcp chat
```

You'll see an interactive chat interface like this:

```
